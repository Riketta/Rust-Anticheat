	* Anticheat - provides protection by speedhacks and other detectable by server things.
- RGuard - client anticheat part  
-------

### FOR TESTERS
##### Tips
Don't use it on your public servers! Anticheat very raw.  
Anticheat fully rewrited and needs huge testing before public release.  
Play on your personal server alone or with friends, who knows about testing.  

##### What to test
- Try to join, leave, join again to server and etc
- Try to use some hacks
- Try to crash client or server
- Play on local and remote servers (127.0.0.1 and not).

Report me all founded bugs and attach logs (client: logs in root game folder; server: `server\rowac\logs\`)  
I interested in stability and safety of servers first of all.  

##### What need to test first of all:
- Capture normal player speed (without cheats)
- Speedhack/flyhack/teleporting protect (with using your captured data)
- Not tested on pirated clients/servers
- Playing with more than one client or player on server.

##### Also - performance of client/server
Tell me, if you have problems with it

--------------------------------
### Features that anticheat can:
- Kick people without anticheat
- Take screenshots
- Take players tasklists
- Kick/ban players with speedhacks, teleports, flyhacks
- Client-server traffic encryption
- Works with Steam version (legal)
- Works with pirated version.
- Works with server modifications (tested with Fougerite, a bit with Oxide).


### Anticheat DON'T provides protection by (at least now):
- hunger hack
- radiation hack
- calorie hack
- server crash hack
- uLink server flood
- e.t.c. like this.  

Use Fougerite (server modification - fougerite.com) to prevent it.  
You SHOULD use some server modification, because vanilla rust servers weak by itself, especially legacy.

How to install
------------------
**server.legacy**
1. Copy RowAC.dll (and RowAC.pdb, if you have) to rust_legacy\rust_server_Data\Managed\
2. Copy RowPatcher.exe and Mono.Cecil.dll to rust_legacy\rust_server_Data\Managed\
3. BACKUP YOUR CLEAR Assembly-CSharp.dll!
4. [DON'T PATCH, IF YOUR LIBs ALREADY PATCHED!!!] Launch patcher (RowPatcher.exe), and do what it asks.
5. Copy RowAC.ini to rust_legacy\ACLog\ (create, if it doesn't exist) and configure it how you like.
6. Open port 28165 (at the moment you can't change it, sorry) in your firewall.
7. [OPTIONAL] now you can obfuscate your server anticheat dlls with `tools\ConfuserEx.bat`
8. Now you can start server.

**client.legacy**
1. Copy RGuard.dll (and RGuard.pdb, if you have) to Rust\rust_Data\Managed\
2. Copy RowPatcher.exe and Mono.Cecil.dll to Rust\rust_Data\Managed\
3. BACKUP YOUR CLEAR Assembly-CSharp.dll!
4. [DON'T PATCH, IF YOUR LIBs ALREADY PATCHED!!!] Launch patcher (RowPatcher.exe), and do what it asks.
5. [OPTIONAL, RECOMMENDED] now you can obfuscate your client anticheat dlls with `tools\ConfuserEx.bat`
6. Now you can play.

--------------
Additional client/server security [OPTIONAL, RECOMMENDED]
--------------
**= RSA**  
RSA-Keys hardcoded into client and server.  
You can change them (check RSA.cs) or use mine.  
**= Obfuscation**  
Use `tools\ConfuserEx.bat` to obfuscate client and/or server dlls.  
**= Screenshots quality**  
Hardcoded as 40%. You can change it in client project.  

----------------------------------------------------------
**Default client timings (right now hardcoded in client)**  
- Ping - every ~10 sec
- No anticheat kicking - ~60 sec
- Screenshots - every ~90 sec
- Tasklist - every ~300 sec
