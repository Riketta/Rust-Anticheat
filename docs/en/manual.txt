### RowAC - Rust [legacy/alpha] client-side anticheat ###
=== Modules
RowAC - server anticheat part
RGuard - client anticheat part

=== FOR TESTERS
# Tips
Don't use it on your public servers! Anticheat very raw.
Anticheat fully rewrited and needs huge testing before public release.
Play on your personal server alone or with friends, who knows about testing.

# What to test
- Try to join, leave, join again to server and etc
- Try to use some hacks
- Try to crash client or server
- Play on local and remote servers (127.0.0.1 and not)

Report me all founded bugs and attach logs (client: logs in root game folder; server: server\ACLog\Logs\)
I interested in stability and safety of your servers first of all.

What untested by me at all:
- Manipulations with join/leave to server
- Speedhack/flyhack/teleporting protect
- Compatibility with server mods
- Not tested on pirate clients/servers
- Playing with more than one client or player on server

=== Features
Anticheat can:
- Kick people without anticheat
- Take screenshots
- Take players tasklists
- Kick/ban players with speedhacks, teleports, flyhacks
- Works with Steam version (legal)
- Works with pirated version.
- Works with server modifications (tested with Fougerite)

Anticheat DON'T provides protection by (at least now):
- hunger hack
- radiation hack
- calorie hack
- server crash hack
- uLink server flood
- e.t.c. like this.
Use Fougerite (server modification - fougerite.com) to prevent it.

=== How to install
# server.legacy
Copy RowAC.dll (and RowAC.pdb, if you have) to rust_legacy\rust_server_Data\Managed\
Copy RowPatcher.exe and Mono.Cecil.dll to rust_legacy\rust_server_Data\Managed\
BACKUP YOUR CLEAR Assembly-CSharp.dll!
Launch patcher (RowPatcher.exe), and do what it asks.
Copy RowAC.ini to rust_legacy\ACLog\ (create, if it doesn't exist) and configure it how you like.
Open port 28165 (at the moment you can't change it, sorry) in your firewall.
Now you can start server.
